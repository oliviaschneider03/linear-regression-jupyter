## Assignment 3 Read Me
## Purpose of the assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to get us used to maneuvering GitHUb for saving and updating our coding work. We learned how to clone our work and use branches as well as how to pull and merge those branches with the main.

Additionally, we learned how to improve upon our linear regression work by adding more statistical analyses (MSE) as well as linear model slope and equation. We learned how to place text and legends on our graphs too. 

## Tools and libraries used 
For R: 
ggplot2 - visualization plot for R; 
summary command - used to produce statistical analyses on the data we have input; 
lm command - used to determine the appropriate model for our data; 
coef command - used to calculate slope and intercept;
mean command - used to calculate mse value 

For Python:
Pandas - used for working with panel data;
Matplotlib - used for creating visualizations; 
Numpy - used for calculations and working with arrays; 
Os - used for looking at different file extensions;
Scikit-learn - used as a machine learning library that allowed us to have linear regression model; 
scipy - library with many mathematical equations;
def with if statements command - used to define a function and classify it as desired;
.iloc[#,#]to_numpy() command - used to define arrays from data frame; 
linegress - used to add linear model to the graph and to calculate slope, intercept, etc.; 
mse command- used to calculate mse; 
matplotlib.scatter command (as well as other formatting commands)- makes a scatter plot and formats it;
model.score command - produce R squared value 

## Notes on Results 

Our results included printing 2 graphs, one in python and one in R, that all included linear model equation, the r value, and the MSE value. From these graphs we were able to determine that our model had a high MSE value which is indicative of a poor model fit (although it is axes dependent) and a high r value which indicates a good fit. 

Additionally, as long as my next steps work, we will have learned how to make a branch, edit our documents and push them to that branch, and then pull and merge these updates to our main branch.

## Previously Written Assignment 2 Read Me
## Purpose of assignment
The goal of this assignment was to be able to generate graphs in both R and python from a csv file of data. We also wanted to be able to learn basic commands on how to manipulate that graph such as color of the points, graph titles, and adding lines of regression. Additionally, we utilized data analysis software on each (R and python) to get summary data about each graph, specifically the R squared value. 

After completing R and python coding we learned technical skills of moving about Jupyter lab. For instance, we made our notebook files into html files and executable scripts so that we could generate grsph images and save them to our folder. 

Lastly, this assignment helped us become more familiar with pushing our files to GitHub and learning to do that often.

## Notes on results
From this excercise we were able to produce 2 graphs from the same data set that included linear regression models which is a very helpful tool in data science. We also are able to publish these results on GitHub which is a central hub for data scientists to record and save their codes which will prove helpful as we progress into our scientific careers.

## Purpose of assignment
The goal of this assignment was to be able to generate graphs in both R and python from a csv file of data. We also wanted to be able to learn basic commands on how to manipulate that graph such as color of the points, graph titles, and adding lines of regression. Additionally, we utilized data analysis software on each (R and python) to get summary data about each graph, specifically the R squared value. 

After completing R and python coding we learned technical skills of moving about Jupyter lab. For instance, we made our notebook files into html files and executable scripts so that we could generate grsph images and save them to our folder. 

Lastly, this assignment helped us become more familiar with pushing our files to GitHub and learning to do that often. 

## Tools and libraries used
For R: 
ggplot2 - visualization plot for R 
summary command - used to produce statistical analyses on the data we have input 

For Python:
Pandas - used for working with panel data
Matplotlib - used for creating visualizations 
Scikit-learn - used as a machine learning library that allowed us to have linear regression model 
scipy - library with many mathematical equations
matplotlib.scatter command (as well as other formatting commands)- makes a scatter plot and formats it
model.score command - produce R squared value 

## Notes on results
From this excercise we were able to produce 2 graphs from the same data set that included linear regression models which is a very helpful tool in data science. We also are able to publish these results on GitHub which is a central hub for data scientists to record and save their codes which will prove helpful as we progress into our scientific careers.
